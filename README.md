\# Smart Parking System – Arduino 🚗



\## Overview

This project implements a smart parking management system using Arduino.

The system counts vehicles, controls a servo-based barrier gate,

and optionally activates a buzzer when parking capacity is reached.



Multiple versions of the project are included:

\- Basic parking system

\- Parking system with buzzer alert

\- Parking system without buzzer



\## Features

\- Vehicle counting logic

\- Servo motor barrier control

\- 16x2 / 20x4 LCD display for status

\- Capacity limit handling

\- Optional buzzer alert when full

\- Expandable modular structure



\## Project Versions



\### 1. CountParkSystemBUZZER100x20Servo

Includes:

\- LCD display

\- Servo gate control

\- Buzzer alert

\- Vehicle counter logic



\### 2. ParkSystemBUZZER100x20Servo

Parking system with buzzer alert functionality.



\### 3. ParkSystemWithOutBuzzer100x20Servo

Parking system without buzzer (silent mode).



\## Hardware Components

\- Arduino board (Uno or compatible)

\- Servo motor

\- 16x2 or 20x4 LCD display

\- Buzzer (optional version)

\- IR / ultrasonic sensor (depending on configuration)

\- Resistors

\- Jumper wires



\## System Logic

\- Detect vehicle entry

\- Increment vehicle counter

\- Display current count on LCD

\- Control servo barrier position

\- Trigger buzzer if maximum capacity is reached



\## Future Improvements

\- Add IoT monitoring using ESP8266

\- Add cloud logging

\- Add RFID access control

\- Add mobile application interface
